# Bubble_Pop
Interactive game implemented using Pycharm Community Edition 4.0.4. 

Players are prompted to click on shapes of various shapes and colors while accumulating points for each successful click. Shapes with smaller sizes are worth higher point values and points are tracked in real time for the users viewing. There is also a timer that regulates play time.

This project was inspired by the Computer Science department of Berea College along with the NES classic Duck Hunt.
